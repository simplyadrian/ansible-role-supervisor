# ansible-role-supervisor

This role will allow the user to use supervisor for apps

Role Variables
--------------
| variable | description | default | mandatory
|----------|-------------|---------|----------
| `supervisor_program` | Job name | none | yes
| `supervisor_command` | command to run a process | none | yes
| `supervisor_process_name` | A Python string expression that is used to compose the supervisor process name for this process. Important only with supervisor_numprocs usage | yes | no
| `supervisor_numprocs` | Supervisor will start as many instances of this program as named by numprocs. Note that if numprocs > 1, the supervisor_process_name expression must include %(process_num)s | 1 | no
| `supervisor_directory` | A file path representing a directory to which supervisord should temporarily chdir before exec’ing the child | /tmp | no
| `supervisor_umask` | The umask of the supervisord process. | 022 | no
| `supervisor_priority` | The relative priority of the program in the start and shutdown ordering | 999 | no
| `supervisor_autostart` | If true, this program will start automatically when supervisord is started  | true | no
| `supervisor_autorestart` | Specifies if supervisord should automatically restart a process if it exits when it is in the RUNNING state. May be one of false, unexpected, or true | true | no
| `supervisor_startsecs` | The total number of seconds which the program needs to stay running after a startup to consider the start successful  | 10 | no
| `supervisor_startretries` | The number of serial failure attempts that supervisord will allow when attempting to start the program before giving up and putting the process into an FATAL state | 3 | no
| `supervisor_exitcodes` | The list of “expected” exit codes for this program used with autorestart | 0,2 | no
| `supervisor_stopsignal` | The signal used to kill the program when a stop is requested. | TERM | no
| `supervisor_stopwaitsecs` | The number of seconds to wait for the OS to return a SIGCHLD to supervisord after the program has been sent a stopsignal. If this number of seconds elapses before supervisord receives a SIGCHLD from the process, supervisord will attempt to kill it with a final SIGKILL. | 10 | no
| `supervisor_stopasgroup` | If true, the flag causes supervisor to send the stop signal to the whole process group and implies killasgroup is true | false | no
| `supervisor_killasgroup` | If true, when resorting to send SIGKILL to the program to terminate it send it to its whole process group instead, taking care of its children as well | false | no
| `supervisor_user` | Instruct supervisord to use this UNIX user account as the account which runs the program. The user can only be switched if supervisord is run as the root user.  | root | no
| `supervisor_redirect_stderr` | If true, cause the process’ stderr output to be sent back to supervisord on its stdout file descriptor | false | no
| `supervisor_stdout_logfile` | Put process stdout output in this file (and if redirect_stderr is true, also place stderr output in this file). | /var/log/supervisor/stdout.log | no
| `supervisor_stdout_logfile_maxbytes` | The maximum number of bytes that may be consumed by stdout_logfile before it is rotated  | 25MB | no
| `supervisor_stdout_logfile_backups` | The number of stdout_logfile backups to keep around resulting from process stdout log file rotation. | 10 | no
| `supervisor_stdout_capture_maxbytes` | Max number of bytes written to capture FIFO when process is in “stdout capture mode” | 5MB | no
| `supervisor_stderr_logfile` | Put process stderr output in this file unless redirect_stderr is true. Accepts the same value types as stdout_logfile | /var/log/supervisor/stderr.log | no
| `supervisor_stderr_logfile_maxbytes` | The maximum number of bytes before logfile rotation for stderr_logfile. Accepts the same value types as stdout_logfile_maxbytes. | 25MB | no
| `supervisor_stderr_logfile_backups` | The number of backups to keep around resulting from process stderr log file rotation. | 10 | no
| `supervisor_stderr_capture_maxbytes` | Max number of bytes written to capture FIFO when process is in “stderr capture mode”  | 5MB | no
| `supervisor_environment` | A list of key/value pairs in the form KEY="val",KEY2="val2" that will be placed in the child process’ environment | { } | no
| `supervisor_version` | supervisor version to be installed | 3.0b2-1  | no
| `supervisor_restart_on_finish` | notify handler which restarts supervisor | true | no
| `supervisor_restart_sleep` | Version of supervisor above defaults to 5 second sleep between stop and start in /etc/init.d/supervisor | 5 | no
